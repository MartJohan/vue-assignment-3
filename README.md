# vue-assignment-3
---

This is the second assignment that is part of the frontend course. We were tasked to make a quiz game using the Vue js framework

We worked on this assignment in a group consisting of me (Maritn Johansen) and Martin Stenberg.

The project also contains a pdf file representing the component tree.
